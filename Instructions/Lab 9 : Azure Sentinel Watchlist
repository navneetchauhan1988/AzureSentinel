# Lab : Azure Sentinel watchlist

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Azure Sentinel watchlists enable the collection of data from external data sources for correlation with the events in your Azure Sentinel environment. 
Once created, you can use watchlists in your search, detection rules, threat hunting, and response playbooks. 
Watchlists are stored in your Azure Sentinel workspace as name-value pairs and are cached for optimal query performance and low latency.

## Lab scenario

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Azure Sentinel. You must create watchlist based on the Indicator of Compromise (IoC) provided.
In this scenario we will pretend a valid IPAddress as an IoC






## Exercise 1 : Add a CSV in watchlist

## Task 1: Note  IP Address  to simulate as an IoC

1. In Azure Sentinel , select **Logs**

2. In Query editor , type **AzureActivity**
 












Results: You have now completed this lab.
