A security playbook is a collection of procedures that can be run from Azure Sentinel in response to an alert. 
A security playbook can help automate and orchestrate your response, and can be run manually or set to run automatically when specific alerts are triggered. 
Security playbooks in Azure Sentinel are based on Azure Logic Apps, which means that you get all the power, customizability, 
and built-in templates of Logic Apps. Each playbook is created for the specific subscription you choose, but when you look at the Playbooks page, 
you will see all the playbooks across any selected subscriptions.
