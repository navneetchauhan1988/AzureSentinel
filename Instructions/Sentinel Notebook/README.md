## Jupyter Notebook Hands-on Lab
Introduction hands-on lab for Jupyter Notebooks, intended to get acquainted with the concepts & technology to be used in the context of Azure Sentinel. <br>

#### Lab flow
Create an Azure Data Science VM to host your Notebooks, then create a Notebook from scratch and start building it out. You will connect to your Sentinel workspace, create some queries and import several libraries which will demonstrate why Jupyter notebooks are so powerful by combining Sentinel data with external data, leveraging data manipulation. <br><br>
**Optionally**, you can install a docker container on your laptop which will host your Notebooks locally.
<br>

The labs are intended to *not* provide you "hand-held step-by-step" guidance, so you need to think about what it is that you are doing. Feel free to deviate at any time from the labs to go explore Jupyter for yourselves.<br>
This is the reason we are not starting with cloning existing notebooks, because I think there's limited learning in doing so.
<br>

#### Happy Hunting!
