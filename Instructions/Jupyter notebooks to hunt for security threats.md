The foundation of Azure Sentinel is the data store; it combines high performance querying, dynamic schema, and scales to massive data volumes.
The Azure portal and all Azure Sentinel tools use a common API to access this data store. 
The same API is also available for external tools such as Jupyter notebooks and Python. While many common tasks can be carried out in the portal, 
Jupyter extends the scope of what you can do with this data. It combines full programmability with a huge collection of libraries for machine learning, 
visualization, and data analysis. 
These attributes make Jupyter a compelling tool for security investigation and hunting.
